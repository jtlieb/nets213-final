## Code files
The following files are used to generate the CSV files in order to create HITs for the MTurkers
- `aggregation_module.py`: Appends previous story contributions from HIT results to a new CSV used to generate the HITs for the next iteration.
- `QCInput.py`: Creates CSV used to generate HITs to filter out unusable story lines written in the previous iteration.
- `QCOutput.py`: Creates CSV used to generate HITs for the next iteration of the story.

## Analysis
We plan to analyze the feasibility of having MTurkers come up with comprehensible storylines that continues from previously crowdsourced stories. We may do some analysis that evaluates the quality and creativity of the writings as well.
