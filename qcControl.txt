Sample input/output from QC module

Turkers will be shown the summarized story so far as well as as the six options that 
three other workers submitted. In addition to these six options there will be two options that
are NOT to be selected. We will not use the submissions of any workers who vote for either of these two. 
The Turker's task will be to read the summarized version of the story so far and select the two options
that make the most logical sense as possible next actions for the player. 

An example:
